# Odin_Project_landing_page
 Landing page from Odin Project

My first landing page. It is not mobile friendly, at least not yet, since that was not necessary for this project.

I am pretty sure I would have written less code if I went the grid layout way and would have taken less time to finish the project too, but I wanted to only use what was part of the Foundations so I used flexbox and margins and paddings to make the page look similar to the layout shared by The Odin Project.
